# Lending Club Case Study
> The object of this case study is to find which types of loans have been defaulted in the Past and 
implement EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the 
tendency of default. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, 
which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of the loan, 
lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

  based on driving variables.

  analyze the loan status wrt to other driving columns.
